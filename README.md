# Imperfect EK-NN

A python version of the Evidential K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

### Summary

When the data are labeled in an uncertain and imprecise way, the credible K-nearest neighbor model can be used for a classification problem.
The model presented here uses a computation of the gamma parameter that differs from the original model of Thierry Den≈ìux.

### Reference

When using this code please refer to [Paper being published](https://github.com/ArthurHoa/imperfect_eknn/new/master?readme=1)

### Example

For k = 2, a new observation with its two nearest neighbors labeled I think *it's a dog* will be labeled *I think it's a dog*.
